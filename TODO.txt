BUG: Ollama may not be working but I think its a local issue.


(for me) TODO: Test MCP, It's all AI generated and I'vnt touched any of it yet.
(for me) TODO: Code was added to configure the keybinds by AI but I haven't tested it yet.

TODO: Add a way to manually call tools from the chat.
- if they are clicked from the tool list it creates a widget with inputs to fill out
- Also if the chat message starts with "tool:" then it will try to call the tool with the name after the colon.
- have it so the tool call is automatically added as context to this.messages as well.

TODO: Allow OpenAI badge to be clicked on to temporarily disable openai, grey it out but with a slight glow?

TODO: The tool list spawns in a weird spot directly under the command bar.
- Shift the tool list upwards to make room for the tool list.
- Both this and the command bar should be able to be dragged around if grabing the background.

TODO: Add a settings menu.
- Custom system prompt to be injected into all system messages.
- Allow the user to configure the keybinds.
- A key/value table that has a list of api keys or configuration snippets for tools 

BUG: Github has keybinds that conflict with the command palette, stealing the input.
