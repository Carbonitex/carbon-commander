(for me) TODO: Test MCP, It's all AI generated and I'vnt touched any of it yet.

TODO: Add a way to manually call tools from the chat.
- if they are clicked from the tool list it creates a widget with inputs to fill out
- Also if the chat message starts with "tool:" then it will try to call the tool with the name after the colon.
- have it so the tool call is automatically added as context to this.messages as well.

BUG: Github has keybinds that conflict with the command palette, stealing the input.
IDEA: Tool suggestions while they are typing? Or maybe as a secondary prompt after the AI answer.

TODO: 'Esc' should close the topmost carbon window.
- stop AI and TOOLS immediately if they are running, dont close window, glow it red.
- broadcast the event so other files can handle it too.

TODO: Hit space on empty chat should do a deep prompt to AI to give suggestions.
