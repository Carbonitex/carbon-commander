(for me) TODO: Test MCP, It's all AI generated and I'vnt touched any of it yet.

TODO: Add a way to manually call tools from the chat.
- if they are clicked from the tool list it creates a widget with inputs to fill out
- Also if the chat message starts with "tool:" then it will try to call the tool with the name after the colon.
- have it so the tool call is automatically added as context to this.messages as well.

BUG: Github has keybinds that conflict with the command palette, stealing the input.
IDEA: Tool suggestions while they are typing? Or maybe as a secondary prompt after the AI answer.

TODO: Make autocomplete better.
- Maybe it could request a list of responses and show multiple choices?
- Should it generate a summary of messages and inputs as they come in, use that as context?

TODO: finish user confirmation for user data.
