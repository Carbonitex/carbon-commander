BUG: Ollama may not be working but I think its a local issue.

(for me) TODO: Test MCP, It's all AI generated and I'vnt touched any of it yet.

TODO: Code was added to configure the keybinds by AI but I haven't tested it yet.
- A Ctrl+K is a common keybind, maybe pick another default?

TODO: Add a way to manually call tools from the chat.
- if they are clicked from the tool list it creates a widget with inputs to fill out
- Also if the chat message starts with "tool:" then it will try to call the tool with the name after the colon.
- have it so the tool call is automatically added as context to this.messages as well.

TODO: Add a settings menu.
- Custom system prompt to be injected into all system messages.
- Allow the user to configure the keybinds.
- A key/value table that has a list of api keys or configuration snippets for tools 

BUG: Github has keybinds that conflict with the command palette, stealing the input.
