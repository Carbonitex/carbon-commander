# Contributing to Carbon Commander

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for being interested in contributing to Carbon Commander. This project is pretty unique - most of the code was actually generated through pair programming with AI (specifically Claude + Cursor). I think that's pretty cool, and it shows how we can leverage AI to build complex software while still maintaining quality and readability.

## The AI-First Development Approach

One of the most interesting aspects of this project is how it was built. Rather than writing everything from scratch, I worked with AI to:
- Design the architecture and core features
- Generate initial implementations
- Refactor and improve code
- Add new features and capabilities
- Write documentation and tests
- Update this file to be less generic and more specific to this project. (lol)

This means that when you contribute, you're not just working with my code - you're working with code that was collaboratively created between human and AI. Pretty neat, right?

## How to Contribute

I'm super open to contributions! Whether you want to:
- Fix bugs you've found
- Add cool new features
- Improve the documentation
- Suggest better ways to use AI in the development process
- Share ideas for new tools or integrations

The process is pretty straightforward:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your awesome improvements
4. Submit a PR

Don't worry too much about getting everything perfect - we can iterate and improve things together. I'm happy to provide feedback and suggestions.

## Using AI in Your Contributions

Feel free to use AI assistants (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) when working on your contributions! Just make sure to:
- Review and understand the generated code
- Test that everything works as expected
- Document any interesting AI interactions that led to your solution
- Keep the code quality high (AI can sometimes take shortcuts)

## A Note About the License

The project uses the LGPL-3.0 License. This means you can:
- Use the code in your own projects (even commercial ones)
- Modify and distribute the code
- Keep your own code private when using this as a library

Just make sure any changes to Carbon Commander itself remain open source.

## Need Help?

If you're stuck, have questions, or just want to bounce ideas around:
- Open an issue on GitHub
- Check out the existing discussions
- Reach out to me directly

Don't be shy about asking questions - I'm always excited to help people get involved with the project!

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Found a bug? Have a cool idea? Awesome! When you create an issue, try to include:
- What you were trying to do
- What actually happened
- Any error messages or unexpected behavior
- Ideas for how to fix/implement it

The more context you provide, the easier it is for me (and the AI) to help out!

## Code Style

I try to keep things consistent but not overly rigid:
- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Follow the existing code style when possible
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting PRs
- Add comments for anything non-obvious

## The Most Important Thing

Have fun with it! This project is all about exploring what's possible when humans and AI work together to build software. Your contributions are helping push that boundary forward.

Thanks for being part of this experiment in AI-assisted development! ðŸš€
